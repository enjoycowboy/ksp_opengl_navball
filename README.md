KSP OpenGL Navball
==================

KSP OpenGL Navball is exactly what the name says, an external navball created
in C++/OpenGL which communicates with the game using the Telemachus plugin.

The purpose of this is manyfold, mainly for my own hobby programming, learning
some C++, OpenGL and down the road learning to control the rockets given data
from the game. Specifically I was interested in control systems, which is why
this project exists at all. Yeah, I took the long way around.

Installation and usage will follow if this ever gets to a useful state, right
now this is only on Github (instead of my private Git) because I want to be
able to use the Github issue system.
